        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <blockquote>
        This 2016 Disney film tells the harrowing true story of a daring coast guard rescue
        that happened off the coast of Massuchesetts in February 1952. This tale encapsulates 
        the rescue of a T2 tanker that had split in half with 32 sailors still on board. Bernie Webber,
        a young member of the United States Coastguard, is tasked to attempt to rescue them.
        This is a story of love, courage, and teamwork that will have you on the edge of your seat.
